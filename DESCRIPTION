Description: A comprehensive suite of functions for interfacing
    with the Survey Solutions APIs
    (<https://demo.mysurvey.solutions/apidocs/index.html> and
    <https://demo.mysurvey.solutions/graphql/>).  It supports all the
    current POST, GET, and PATCH requests of the 'REST API' and extends
    its capabilities by integrating selected 'GraphQL' API queries and
    mutations when 'REST API' equivalents are not available. Designed for
    ease of use, it includes several convenience functions to streamline
    operations.  The package ensures that data retrieved from the API is
    automatically transformed into a single, easy-to-use 'data.frame',
    optimizing it for subsequent analysis and processing. Additionally, it
    is specifically designed to facilitate seamless integration into R
    Shiny applications, enhancing the interactive web application
    development experience. Built on the robust 'httr2' package, this
    version supersedes the previous 'httr-based' implementation.
    Recognizing the needs of large-scale data operations such as censuses,
    the package also incorporates features for parallel processing,
    enhancing its efficiency and scalability.
