# SurveySolutionsAPIv2 0.1.0

* added new classes: UserClass exportClass and methods, like boxplot_summary.exportClass, summaryTable.exportClass
* to have consistency across all function arguments, all functions now have server, apiUser, apiPass, as their arguments. This may break some code from the old SurveySolutionAPI package, but affects only a few functions (see vignette for syntax changes) .
* extended suso_getINT, such that if no sv_id is provided, it will return all interviewers in the workspace.
* suso_PwCheck now prints a message and the URL to the console when in interactive mode
* suso_getINT_info now covers both interviewer details and retrieval of log files (log = T)
* workspace has been added to suso_set_key
* translation can be applied to export data for categorical variables
* export allows to add weights file, so the data is analysis ready
* more informative error messages by using the rlang and the cli package
* implemented parallelisation of requests with the httr2 req_perform_parallel function, reducing i.e. assignment creation to a fraction of a sequential process (use options to customize settings)
* export classes produces (optional) DT summary table and ggplot2 summary plots
* paradata time difference calculation is now based on milliseconds and includes information about questionnaire items, like question type etc.
