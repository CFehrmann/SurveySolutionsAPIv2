This is a new edition of the [Survey Solutions R API package](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/api/api-r-package/), based on the recently (as stable) released [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/index.html) package. Most of the syntax are the same as in the existing httr based [SurveySolutionsAPI](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPI) package, and therefore it should be easy to integrate it in your existing workflow, if you have used the previous edition so far. 

But besides a few syntax changes as well as several other updates like more meaningful error messages using the [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org/) and the [rlang](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) packages there are also quite a bunch of new features. Therefore i decided to release this package as a completely new one, such that users who do not want to switch to the new package or make use of the new features, can still work with the old package as usual. Nevertheless a transition to the new package is recommended.

Additionally the package also seeks a deeper integration with the updated [susographql](https://github.com/michael-cw/susographql) package, wich now also is purely based on the httr2 package.

### New features in this package specific to one or several functions are:

- **suso_get_stats_interview, suso_get_assignments, suso_createUSER, suso_createASS, suso_getSV** and **suso_getINT** with potentially long running jobs now use httr2's parallel request feature, which reduces processing time substantially. For example 10k assignments can now be created in about 200 seconds.In particular in large scale surveys and censuses, this feature may facilitat working with the API considerably.
- **suso_set_key:** workspace can now be set as an environment variable, like it was already the case for server, user and password.
- **suso_export:** now has the option to merge all the data export files into a single data table and also add survey weights, for analysis ready data sets.
- **suso_export:** of spatial (map question) data (i.e. polygons, point locations, lines) can be processed into [sf (simple feature)](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) objects directly, by setting *process_mapquestions = TRUE*.
- **suso_export:** now also processes available value labels and applies them to categorical variables, as well as variable labels. In case you have also translations for your questionnaire, these can be used as well.
- **suso_export_paradata:** now uses milliseconds for all time based calculations, and also adds comprehensive questionnaire information to the data, like i.e. question type.
- **suso_export_paradata:** now also identifys gps variable in your questionnaire, and uses it, to provide location data to the paradata.
- **suso_mapupload, suso_mapassign, suso_maps, suso_mapreport** and **suso_deletemap** now also enable complete map management with a single package, and the same syntax/outputs[^1].

### New general features in this package are:

- New classes and methods, i.e.: AssignmentClass, ExportClass, UserClass, and methods like summaryTable.exportClass (DT based) or boxplot_summary.exportClass (ggplot2 based).
- Http error messages are translated into R errors, and use the error codes (and messages as provided by the Survey Solutions API response), which makes debugging easier.
- Several options, which allows the user to customize processing to their environment, like: *suso.maxpar.req* for the maximum number of parallel requests, *suso.para.break* for customizing breaks when calculating paradata response times or *suso.para.tz* for setting the time zone.


Again, and even more than the previous httr based API package, this package is more than just a simple wrapper around the Survey Solutions REST API (or GraphQL) endpoints. The main intention of this package though, is to be integrated into your own data collection workflow, either through a shiny application or just through a simple script without a lot of addtional data wrangling and adjustments. As such, the package allows you to build your own workflows with your own customized user interfaces for your Survey Solutions data collection operations, no matter if you are dealing with a small scale impact evaluation or a large scale census. For this reason, the API calls return easy to process data tables, and in some cases, like paradata, even add additional variables useful for further processing. For example the outputs of the newly added *summaryTable.exportClass* and *boxplot_summary.exportClass* can be used in a shiny application right away, by either using renderDT or renderPlotly.

Important to note here is, that the package also makes extensive use of the **data.table** package, which allows for fast (multi-core) processing of large data sets. The individual functions either return a data.table, or a specific S3 extension of data.table, with individual methods defined. In case you are not familiar with it yet, you should probably have a look a this [introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).

Nevertheless, in case you don't require the capacities offered by data.table, you can still treat the return objects like a data frame or even continue with it in the tidyverse. A package which combines both worlds is the [dtplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dtplyr) package, and for a comparison between the dplyr package and the data.table package see [here](https://atrebas.github.io/post/2019-03-03-datatable-dplyr/). 

Specific changes in version 0.6.X:

- Preparation for token authentication (not active yet)
- Map handling and management: suso_mapupload(), suso_mapassign(), suso_mapinfo()
- Introduction of S3 classes for return values, such that all information returned from the API can be used
efficiently. See news for further details and classes.

## Installation

The package is not on CRAN yet, so you have to install it by using

``` r

devtools::install_github("michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPIv2", build_vignettes = T)

```

The included vignettes also contain different examples and further explanations. Bellow you can find a few examples. 


## Examples

### Credentials Management


To use the API you first need to set-up the API user on your Survey Solutions server. See [here](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/api/) for details. After this done, you can use the *suso_set_key()* function, to provide your credentials.


```r
library(SurveySolutionsAPIv2)
suso_clear_keys()
suso_set_key("https://xxx.mysurvey.solutions", "xxxxxx", "xxxxxxx")
suso_keys()
#> $suso
#> $suso$susoServer
#> [1] "https://xxx.mysurvey.solutions"
#> 
#> $suso$susoUser
#> [1] "xxxxxx"
#> 
#> $suso$susoPass
#> [1] "xxxxxxx"
#> 
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "suso_api"
```


### Workspace Management

You can also manage your workspaces through the API. In particular, you can

- request a list of all workspaces the API user has access to, as well as
- create new workspaces
- and assign users to a particular workspace.

However for the latter two operations you require ADMIN credentials. Standard API user credentials would not work.

To receive a list of workspaces to which the current API user has access to, you can just run:


```r
ws <- suso_getWorkspace()
print(head(ws))
#>       Name       DisplayName DisabledAtUtc
#> 1: primary Default Workspace            NA
#> 2:    test              test            NA
#> 3:   test2             test2            NA
```

### User Management

These functions are particularly useful for survey management, and more details can be found in the corresponding vignette on survey management. Lets start with getting a list of all supervisors on the server.


```r
sv <- suso_getSV(workspace = "test")
print(head(sv))
#>    IsLocked        CreationDate                               UserId   UserName
#> 1:    FALSE 2023-02-07 17:33:40 00d21677-0331-4698-ae7b-908aeac14dd6 somesvuser
#> 2:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:05:10 ded27a4a-716d-4bf2-8d54-aedc31fc164b     SV0001
#> 3:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:36:03 5753ddde-3c7d-438f-9934-43fdf18fa802     SV0002
#> 4:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:36:03 72196c84-8f2f-488a-8d61-f23b8b998d43     SV0003
#> 5:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:36:03 1a9d4b10-c92d-401d-af69-2a7d0a391fe6     SV0004
#> 6:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:36:03 97e9e4ff-22e1-492f-a102-03c2115903e7     SV0005
```

### Questionnaire Management

The basic questionnaire API calls are handled through the *suso_getQuestDetails* function.

If no input is provided, the function returns a list of all questionnaires on the server:


```r
questlist <- suso_getQuestDetails(workspace = "test")
# print(questlist)
```

Specifying *operation.type = status*, you receive a list of statuses.


```r
statlist <- suso_getQuestDetails(operation.type = "statuses", workspace = "test")
print(statlist)
#>  [1] "Restored"               "Created"                "SupervisorAssigned"     "InterviewerAssigned"    "RejectedBySupervisor"   "ReadyForInterview"      "SentToCapi"            
#>  [8] "Restarted"              "Completed"              "ApprovedBySupervisor"   "RejectedByHeadquarters" "ApprovedByHeadquarters" "Deleted"
```

By taking a particular *QuestionnaireId* and specifying the *operation.type *you can execute further requests. For example,

### Data Export

To export the data collected in Survey Solutions, you use *suso_export*.


```
#> The last file has been created 0.06833 hours ago.
#> FileName: assignment__actions 
#> Nesting Level: 0 
#> ****
#> 
#> FileName: households 
#> Nesting Level: 1 
#> ****
#> 
#> FileName: interview__actions 
#> Nesting Level: 0 
#> ****
#> 
#> FileName: interview__diagnostics 
#> Nesting Level: 0 
#> ****
#> 
#> FileName: interview__errors 
#> Nesting Level: 0 
#> ****
```

Its return value is a list with the following elements: main, R1, R2, R3, with

- **main** containing the files: interview__comments, kasai_listing1
- **R1** containing all rosters at the first level
- **R2** containing all rosters at the second level
- **R3** containing all rosters at the third level

through the harmonized ID, main and roster files can easily be put together. More on this in the specific vignette.

## Paradata Export

To retrieve the paradata for a particular interview you use *suso_export_paradata*

```r
system.time(para1 <- suso_export_paradata(questID = questlist[1, QuestionnaireId], workspace = "test", version = questlist[1, Version], reloadTimeDiff = 24, onlyActiveEvents = F, allResponses = T))
#> 
#> The last file has been created 1 hours ago.
#> 
#> Starting download & file extraction. 
#> 
#> 
#> Calculating Response Timings.
#> 
#> Extracting GPS variable.
#> Processing: 
#> 	AnswerSet
#> 
#> 	AnswerRemoved
#> 
#> 	ApproveByHeadquarter
#> 
#> 	Restarted
#> 
#> 	Reject
#> 
#> 	QuestionDeclaredInvalid
#> 
#> 	QuestionDeclaredValid
#> 
#> Export & Transformation finished.
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.536   0.036   0.820
```
### Map management

Since recently, it is now also possible, to handle maps through the API. This is implemented through the lately introduced GraphQL API.

To upload a map, you can just use the **suso_mapupload** function like this:


```r
suso_mapupload(workspace = "test", path_to_zip = mapPath)
#>    xMaxVal yMaxVal xMinVal yMinVal wkid             fileName  size maxScale minScale shapeType       importDateUtc                           uploadedBy     users
#> 1:  -78.39    26.8  -78.62   26.55 4326 checkshapesimple.shp 20467        0        0   Polygon 2023-02-16 17:24:47 961d073f-f316-4353-9e7e-1f00899cb837 <list[0]>
```

To assign a map you can use the **suso_mapassign** function:


```r
suso_mapassign(workspace = "test", fileName = "checkshapesimple.shp", userName = "INT0004")
#>                fileName    user shapeType       importDateUtc
#> 1: checkshapesimple.shp INT0004   Polygon 2023-02-16 17:24:47
```
